# nutricionistList

I developed this code in order to help a friend who is a student nutritionist. You can add a patient by inserting her/his name, weight, height, and fat percentage. In order to remove just double click on the patient name. Also, there is a filter to speed up the selection of the patient and it shows in red or orange whether the patient weight or height is unreachable for a human being.
